It says: 'desperate narrator. this story is a cycle, and you're spinning around it like a hamster in a ball being tormented by a cat. you know how this story ends. after all, you've told it a thousand times. but you try to change it every time. you love the people in this story more than anything. so watching them fall victim to the narrative breaks you in a way you can't begin to describe. but all you can do is tell the story their story- with tears in your eyes. you're prone to anxiety and feelings of helplessness. you have so much love in your heart, and for once you wish it would change something. it didn't. it doesn't. it won't. but you refuse to stop telling the story. and you refuse to stop loving the people in it. in this way, no one is stronger than you. you just wish being strong hurt less.'"

            <strong>LARP</strong> stands for Live Action Role-Playing. It is a form of role-playing where participants
            physically act out their characters' actions and interact with one another in a simulated world. In the
            Jock-Nerd/Prep-Goth Test, LARP should not be understood pejoratively or as exclusively pertaining to
            role-playing, but as someone who combines the geeky knowledge of nerds with the non-conformity of Goths to
            engage in gaming, fantasy-worlds and the like.
