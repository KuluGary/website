      you want to call it, it's grassroots and it's been steadily growing since even before the global pandemic in 2020.
      We want to stop depending on corporations for everything when it comes to our web services, and we want to help
      promote building more infrastructure to the internet as a whole. We want more people to build websites for
      <em>fun</em>, not just to make money. Everyone benefits from an open, free internet, and that includes more
      self-expression that isn't on social media platforms.
