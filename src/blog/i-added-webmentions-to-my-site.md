description: After looking for ways to add interactivity with my blog posts, I decided to add Webmentions to my site.
---

Something that is usually seen in any kind of blog is a way to interact with each post. Usually you can leave comments, but there are also ways to track likes and shares in social media. Some website authors use a ready-to-use service like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), an automated third-party system [Netlify functions](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/static-site-comments-github-issues/), or something handmade with a custom database.

This website is SSG'd (static-site generated), by which I mean that all the content is pre-built and my hosting service serves raw HTML files. In order to fit the what I want from this website, whatever solution I came up with had to match certain requirements.

- It had to give me full control of how to display the interactions,
- It should be a free and/or open-source solution
- It should not require the user to login into this site or provide any information to me
- It should be simple, unobtrusive and optional

To fulfill all these requirements, I started to look around the web. Enter [Webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention).

## Webmentions

Paraphrasing W3C, webmentions are a way for a website to be notified whenever another site links to it â€“hence, _web mentions_. In this way, instead of having a centralized service to keep track of interactions, it allows a [federated](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)>) approach in which instead of forcing the user to interact with my platform, I simply get notified whenever they do it in any external site.

### Webmention io

There are a lot of ways to implement webmentions, but as far as I've seen a top contender is [webmention.io](https://webmention.io); a simple hosted service to receive webmentions from anywhere, with an API to retrieve these webmentions and showcase them in your site however you like.

Since [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) is a webmention receiver, this should work fine if my site is shared by someone who has webmentions integrated in their site. The only problem is that in this day and age, interaction mostly happens through social media and most of them don't use the webmentions protocol.

For that, there's a service called [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/).

### Bridgy

[brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) monitors any linked social media to see who interacts with your site. If I share a link to this article in [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and someone replies, likes or reposts, [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) would send a webmention to [webmention.io](https://webmention.io), which I could later fetch with their API and showcase it in my site.

### Fetching my webmentions

Once [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) and [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) are sending and receiving webmentions respectively, I then can bring them into my site and handle them as I see fit. Since this site is made with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), I can retrieve my webmentions in a [global data file](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) and have access to them in any of my templates.

To do this I just need to do a simple authorized HTTP Request.

```js
const response = await fetch(
  `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=${process.env.WEBMENTIONS_TOKEN}&per-page=1000`
);

const body = await response.json();
const webmentions = body.children;

return webmentions;
```

With my webmentions available as JSON files, I can hanle them and display them however I want. If you wanna see how they are working, you can check them in [this article's footer](/blog/i-added-webmentions-to-my-site#post-footer).

{% raw %}

```njk
{% set reposts = mentions | webmentionsByType('repost-of') | filterOwnWebmentions %}
{% set likes = mentions | webmentionsByType('like-of') | filterOwnWebmentions %}
{% set replies = mentions | webmentionsByType('in-reply-to')  %}

{% set repostsSize = reposts.length %}
{% set likesSize = likes.length %}
{% set repliesSize = replies.length %}

{% set interactions = likes | mergeArrays(reposts) %}

{# ... #}

<div class="social-media">
	{% if likesSize > 0 %}
		<svg {# ... #}></svg>{{ likesSize }}
	{% endif %}

	{% if repostsSize > 0 %}
		<svg {# ... #}></svg>
		{{repostsSize}}
	{% endif %}

	{% if repliesSize > 0 %}
		<svg {# ... #}></svg>
		{{repliesSize}}
	{% endif %}

	<div class="share-buttons">
		{% include "components/share-buttons.html" %}
	</div>
</div>
```

{%endraw%}

## Next steps

The main problem remaining with my approach to webmentions is the fact that they will only be obtained whenever I choose to rebuild and deploy a new version of the site. The easiest way to fix this may be to configure some sort of cron job to periodically rebuild my site and deploy it, which would also refetch any webmention I may have available.
