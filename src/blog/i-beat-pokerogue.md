I've been playing [PokéRogue](https://pokerogue.net/) on and off for about a week. For those who don't know, it's a [roguelite](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Roguelite/) Pokémon fangame where you go from level 1 to 200 fighting wild Pokémon and trainers, in a never-ending gameplay loop.

In my most recent run (and the only successful one), I've finally beaten the game.

I started the run with **Torchic**, **Magnemite** and **Magikarp**. Through the game, I ended up forming a team of **Blaziken**, **Magneton**, **Gyarados**, **Shiftry**, **Dusknoir** and **Seismitoad**. At one point, I got both the **Mega Bracelet**, and the **Blazikenite** and **Gyaradosite**.

This was my set-up:

|               |              |              |               |              |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| MEGA-BLAZIKEN | Fire Punch   | Swords Dance | Double Kick   | Aerial Ace   |
| MEGA-GYARADOS | Waterfall    | Ice Fang     | Crunch        | Dragon Dance |
| MAGNETON      | Discharge    | Confuse Ray  | Tri-Attach    | Flash Cannon |
| SHIFTRY       | Leaf Blade   | Nasty Plot   | Sucker Punch  | Synthesis    |
| DUSKNOIR      | Shadow Punch | Will-O-Wisp  | Thunder Punch | Payback      |
| SEISMITOAD    | Hydro Pump   | Earth Power  | Hyper Voice   | Acid         |

{.stat-table}

The battle with **Eternatus** was tense. I've lost most of my team against its base form, and by the time I was facing **Eternamax Eternatus**, I had only **Magnezone**, **Dusknoir** and **Shiftry**. Early on I also lost **Shiftry** to a **Poison** move, but I clutched it with my remaining Pokémon.

My strategy was, mostly, hax. Just the floor before **Eternatus** I got a TM for **Mud-Slap** and I taught it to my **Mega Blaziken** over **Swords Dance**, since I knew I would not be able to set-up in the fight. In the first few turns of the battle, I was able to drop the accuracy of **Eternatus** by a few levels, making it miss a few of its attacks.

During the **Eternamax** phase, I used **Dusknoir's Will-O-Wisp** and **Magnezone's Confuse Ray** to make it hit itself and wittle its HP down little by little. It used **Recover** once, but luckily it hit itself in confusion just when it hit red so it couldn't do it again.

I've finally beat him with that combination.

I'll probably do a few more classic runs with different teams before I tackle endless mode.

I highly recommend the game if you like roguelites and/or Pokémon battles.
