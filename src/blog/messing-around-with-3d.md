A few months ago, I played [A Short Hike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/) by recommendation from my partner, and I fell in love with the aesthetic. The concept of the game is very nice and feel-good, but it made me remember how much I loved the look and feel of games like [Digimon World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_World) and other PSX-era low-res 3D games.

While learning Godot, I thought it'd be nice to replicate that aesthetic. Luckily, there are [lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg_V27arKdg&pp=ygUSYSBzaG9ydCBoaWtlIGdvZG90) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBoApONC7bM&pp=ygUSM2QgcGl4ZWwgYXJ0IGdvZG90) [devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRAeiwTA7qs&pp=ygUSM2QgcGl4ZWwgYXJ0IGdvZG90) already applying this effect in their games.

What I made is just a prototype I made just lowering the values for the [resolution](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/resolution_scaling.html) of the game, but there are pros and cons about it.

I'm probably going to keep messing around with this until I have something I'm satisfied with.
