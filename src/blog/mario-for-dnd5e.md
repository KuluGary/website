description: We delve into the challenge of adapting the iconic Nintendo character to the world of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (D&D5e). From acrobatic skills to combat prowess, discover how to seamlessly integrate the famed plumber into your D&D5e campaign.
---

To say that Mario is one of the most iconic video game characters is an understatement. So iconic that it's not uncommon to entertain the idea of using this peculiar plumber in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I am not the first—and probably not the last—to consider this concept. If you search for "Mario D&D5e" on the internet, you'll undoubtedly find dozens of results. Personally, I recommend [this article](https://mikemyler.com/2018/11/16/mario-rpg-dd-5e/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg_oiXcyguo).

## Goals

The goal is to recreate Mario within the constraints of a D&D5e character sheet. The idea is not to make an optimized build but to find a creative way to bring the character to life.

In most iterations —especially in RPGs —Mario is an all-around damage dealer, capable of causing both physical and magical damage. Therefore, Mario should be able to consistently attack in melee while also using some damage and utility spells when necessary.

## Class and Race

Just like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg_oiXcyguo), I also believe that Mario fits fantastically with the Halfling (Stout) race.

As for class, if we look at his iteration in Smash Bros., I would say that a Monk (Way of the Ascendant Dragon) fits very well: agile, entirely melee combat, and with the ability to enhance spells with fire elemental damage. However, for me, it would be much more interesting to draw inspiration from various RPGs, and therefore, I think **Fighter** is a class that suits Mario well: it is basic and versatile, allows for a lot of customization, lets you fight with and without weapons, allows you to prioritize strength and/or dexterity, and gives you a bunch of ability score points useful for a character who is good at everything.

## Levels 1-5

### Level 1

At this point, we have a dilemma. As I mentioned earlier, Mario fits well as a Halfling, however, choosing **Custom Lineage** is a much better option. From level 1, it allows us to have better speed (which can affect your jump), better stats, and start with a feat. I'll list both options below: it has a great impact to start with, but at higher levels, it doesn't affect as much.

---

At the first level, we will choose our race (Stout Halfling) and class (Fighter), and if we use standard scores, our stats would look like this:

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15  | 14  | 14  | 8   | 10  | 14  |

{.stat-table}

Or in case you chose Custom Lineage:

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 17  | 12  | 13  | 8   | 10  | 14  |

{.stat-table}

As you can see, we focus on Strength. Although one might think that Mario is a very agile character and therefore should focus on Dexterity, the truth is that his feats in the games dictate otherwise. He often uses grappling against Bowser, fights using a two-handed warhammer, and above all: he is a master jumper. In D&D5e, it's Strength that determines how far you can jump.

At the first level, our class allows us to choose a **Fighting Style** and for Mario, we will choose **Unarmed Fighting** introduced in _Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_. This fighting style allows us to use a d6 + Strength modifier to attack, or if you're not wielding a shield or weapon in either of your hands, a d8. Additionally, it allows us to deal 1d4 damage to a creature we have grappled. As you'll see in the following levels, we're going to take advantage of grabbing and pushing enemies.

If we have also Custom Lineage as our race, we can choose a **Feat** at first level. We will pick up **Skill Expert** from _Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_, which allows us to grant a +1 to an ability score (in our case, Strength) and also gain proficiency and expertise in a skill of our choice. We will choose _Athletics_, for two reasons. First: Mario's feats of physical strength are countless and always well above what would be logical for someone of his size. Second: proficiency in Athletics is essential for an unarmed combat and grappling build.

### Level 2

The second level is always crucial for Fighters, as they gain access to one of their most important abilities: **Action Surge**. Although it may seem insignificant, it actually doubles our combat potential and is of great value.

### Level 3

Here we have a fork in the road. As Mario, we will continue our path as a Fighter, but it's time to choose a Subclass, and two in particular fit thematically with our plumber.

#### Eldritch Knight

As an Eldritch Knight, we gain the option to use spells. Thematically, the spells **Create Bonfire** and **Fire Bolt** are perfect for a Mario who can brawl in melee but also possesses his classic fireballs. As first-level spells, **Absorb Elements** allows you to absorb Bowser's fire breath and throw it back at him, while **Shield** allows us to protect ourselves from powerful enemy attacks. Additionally, we couldn't create Super Mario without choosing the spell **Jump**.

#### Rune Knight

As a Rune Knight, we gain abilities that allow us to excel in melee combat. The **Fire Rune** allows you to restrain your enemies with fiery shackles that cause damage every turn; while the **Frost Rune** gives you a +2 bonus to all Strength and Constitution checks, making you even more effective when using grapples on your enemies.

Additionally, you gain **Giant's Might**, which makes you grow to Large size —something common in Mario games when he consumes a mushroom —giving you advantage on Strength checks and dealing extra damage on your attacks.

### Level 4

At this level, we gain an ability score improvement or feat. In this case, I would choose to increase our Strength to the maximum (20), or if you chose to be a Halfling, now is the time to choose that feat that allows you to round up your Strength (18) and gain proficiency in Athletics.

### Level 5

Finally, as a Fighter, you get your first Extra Attack. Thanks to this, your potential grows exponentially, allowing you to play with more combinations of grabs, punches, and spellcasting (if you chose to be an Eldritch Knight).

### Beyond Level 5

As you level up, you'll gain new abilities that will allow you to be even more excellent in your role. If you went the Eldritch Knight route, when you get 2nd-level spells, you can use the **Enlarge/Reduce** spell, allowing you to grow similar to the Rune Knight.

As a Fighter, you have the unique ability to gain more than two attacks per turn, allowing you to combine attacks, grabs, and shoves as you see fit. Additionally, you'll gain more ability score improvements than any other class, allowing you to increase important modifiers like **Constitution**, **Dexterity**, or **Intelligence** (if you're an Eldritch Knight). On the contrary, there are several feats that will help you fulfill your functions, such as _Tavern Brawler_ or some that give you mobility like _Mobile_.

### Conclusions

In this build, Mario is a classic melee fighter who supplements his unarmed attacks with grabs and spells or size changes. "Grapple builds" are nothing new in D&D5e, and while they may not always be the most effective in terms of pure damage or control, they are a fun way to build your character that also fits well with the type of character Mario is.

#### Pros

- You can use grabs to immobilize creatures.
- As a Fighter, you have the option to fight using martial weapons and heavy armor.
- Thanks to your proficiency in Athletics, you excel in many types of movement (jumping, climbing, etc.).

#### Cons

- You are not particularly good against groups of enemies.
- By using grabs and immobilizations, you are better at increasing your allies' damage potential than causing it yourself.
- When you grab an enemy, you lose a lot of mobility and expose yourself to enemy attacks.

## Alternatives

Although in this article, we have decided to make Mario a Fighter specialized in melee attacks and grabs, Mario is a naturally versatile character that lends itself to be created in multiple ways. Since he has dozens of incarnations, it's challenging to think of a build that doesn't fit him at all, but I'll leave a small list of alternatives for you to get inspiration from.

- Paladin - Oath of the Crown: Mario has always been a devoted protector of Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom; hence, a paladin acting as his bodyguard is more than suitable. This build would allow Mario to intercept enemies, heal allies in an area, and take damage on their behalf. Additionally, his stats are quite similar to those we have already shown as a Fighter: focusing on Strength and Charisma, with Constitution and Dexterity as secondaries.

- Cleric - Life Domain: So you want to be Dr. Mario? Choosing Cleric allows you to efficiently heal your allies, but don't think it's not an offensive build. You'll end up mopping the floor with your enemies, and there will be time to heal your allies outside of combat turns, especially with Channel Divinity: Preserve Life.

- Monk - Way of the Ascendant Dragon: As I mentioned earlier, if you primarily want the Smash Bros. Mario, this monk is for you. While the basic class allows you to be a great melee fighter while being agile and elusive, the subclass gives you some control and area of effect fire damage with Breath of the Dragon, allowing you to overcome one of the weaknesses of Monks: fighting against crowds.
