description: It's been a while since I wanted to learn p5.js to make art through code, and in the next few weeks I'm going to be sharing my progress with this library.

A few years back I stumbled onto [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) by [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman), and ended up watching a handful of his videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/). That's where I first came across [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), an open-source JavaScript library built on top of [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing). 

Processing describes itself as:

> [...] a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code.

I've been developing software for a while, but I've never used JavaScript in the context of visual and interactive art. p5.js looked like the perfect excuse to try.

So this is a little learning log. I'll be posting sketches and notes about the journey here on the blog. You can follow along by checking out the [learning-p5js tag](/blog/tags/learning-p5js).
## References and tools

Here are the main references I'll be leaning on:
- [The Coding Train website](https://thecodingtrain.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/).
- The [p5.js documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/).
- The [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
- The [p5 npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5).

And if you're curious about the full setup I'm using, you can check out my [/uses page](/uses#software).

Thanks for following along on this sidequest. Let's see where it goes.
