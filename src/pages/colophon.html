		<p>A <a href="https://indieweb.org/colophon">colophon</a> page explaining the tools, technologies and principles governing this website.</p>

		<p>The source for this site is available in <a href="https://github.com/KuluGary/website">the Github repository</a>.</p>

			<h2>Philosophy</h2>

			<p>When I started this website circa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240413212637/https://kulugary.neocities.org/">2003</a>, I tried to build it in a way that aligned with my priorities:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Provide an accessible and inclusive reading experience for most people. This includes using <a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html">semantic HTML</a> and try to be <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">a11y</a> compliant, minimize the weight of the site to decrease the data use, and create a welcoming atmosphere.</li>
				<li>Make a personal website that reflects myself, my interests and my preferred aesthetics.</li>
				<li>Learn and implement more IndieWeb protocols and create a site as independant from corporate or business owned platforms as possible.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Technologies</h2>

			<p>This website is staticly generated with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and <a  href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, and it uses both HTML template files and Markdown files.
			</p>

			<p>It uses basic CSS as much as is comfortable, but there's some downleveling of new CSS standards with <a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a>.</p>

			<p>The site is hosted on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> as static HTML files and its repository is in <a href="https://github.com/KuluGary/website">Github</a>. The site is deployed through a <a href="https://github.com/KuluGary/website/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-neocities.yml">Github action</a>.</p>

			<p>Webmentions are fetched from <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> and connected to social media with <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>. They are sent thanks to a bash script inspired by <a href="https://localghost.dev/blog/sending-webmentions-from-a-static-site/">localghost.dev</a> at buildtime.

			<h2>Design</h2>

			<p>The base template for the website layout is from <a href="https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/">The Monospace Web</a>. At this point in time, it's been heavily modifided.</p>

			<p>The site uses system fonts to minimize page size and loading times, and every option available at the <a href="/settings">settings page</a> is from <a href="https://modernfontstacks.com/">Modern Font Stacks</a>.</p>

			<p>See more about the design in the <a href="/styleguide">styleguide page</a>.</p>
