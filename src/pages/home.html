    Welcome! I'm the webmaster of this little corner of the internet. I tinker with
    <a href="/blog/tags/development">tech</a>, <a href="/old-stuff#art">dabble in art</a>, and experiment with
    <a href="/blog/tags/game-dev">making games</a>. This site is my playground for sharing projects, experiments and odd
    curiosities.
