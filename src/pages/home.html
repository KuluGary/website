  <p>Hello, I'm Gary.</p>

  <p>
    I'm a <strong>technology enthusiast</strong> with a predilection for vintage
    programs; an <strong>artistic cognoscente</strong> who's dabbled in
    illustration, 3D and pixel art; and a
    <strong>neophyte humanist</strong> with a growing regard for the social
    sciences.
