He chooses his absolute favourite, Digimon World for the original Sony PlayStation, thinking it'll be smooth sailing despite having no previous content creation experience. Hilarity, existential dread and depression ensues.”\n\nAlternative titles:\n„A documentation of a year-long journey of dubious quality”;\n“A much too long, unimportant video”;\n“why”\n\nThis is my guide/walkthrough/let’s play/retrospective/review of Digimon World 1 (PS1). …and talking about other Digimon World games. It's also the first of my \"introspective look\" series, where I look at the game from my past, describe it in detail and get all emotional about it. Needless to say, it's really subjective, so you can't really call this video a \"documentary\". \nBut yeah, after 10 years of dreaming... I actually got myself together and made it a reality. The results are... well... something.\n\nDigimon World is probably the most influential video game I’ve played in my life. That’s why I wanted show everything there is to show about it and maybe, JUST MAYBE influence others to play it for the first time/give it another go. Also, there’s a lot of personal power leveling and possible cringe so… be wary of that. \n\nThere's... not much I can say about it, other than to say \"sorry\" for my English and presentational skills, hope you'll enjoy it at least a little bit.\nI've released separate chapters of this video separately in monthly increments, this is just the \"compilation\" with my desperate fixes (and I'm sure that I've missed some - like calling MetalMamemon \"MetaMamemon\"). I'm tired and probably there won't be more updates to it. ...I hope. I really hope.\n\nI hope that subtitles will be clear enough, sorry for weird grammar, interpunction and butchering of the language.\n\nAs always… this video wouldn’t be possible without the brilliant minds of:\n@SydMontague  https://www.youtube.com/user/sydmontague\n@OperationDecoded  https://www.youtube.com/@OperationDecoded\n@Geta92  https://www.youtube.com/c/Geta92\n@ginoshie  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC170yE3VHur_9JjWM0mb7VA\n\n…and the wonderful music made by:\n@GIROMONSJUKEBOX  https://www.youtube.com/@GIROMONSJUKEBOX\n@eluukkanen  https://www.youtube.com/@eluukkanen\n@SadGatomon  https://www.youtube.com/@SadGatomon\n@GoldRangerkicksass  https://www.youtube.com/@GoldRangerkicksass\n@ectevy2105  https://www.youtube.com/@ectevy2105\n@yoshiUMR https://www.youtube.com/@yoshiUMR\n@JavinThamMusic  https://www.youtube.com/@JavinThamMusic\n\n…and everyone else whose music appeared in this video.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 PROLOGUE\n8:47 OPENING\n23:07 CHAPTER 1 \n1:23:52 CHAPTER 2 \n2:59:17 CHAPTER 2.5 \n3:42:49 CHAPTER 3 \n5:08:58 THE OBLIGATORY REVIEW SEGMENT \n5:47:13 CHAPTER 4 \n6:27:10 THE LEGACY OF DIGIMON WORLD \n7:38:18 CHAPTER 5 \n9:20:50 CREDITS\n9:24:43 EPILOGUE\n\nDARN, the description limit is killing me. You can find detailed timestamps in the pinned comments.\n\nAs this video is over NINE HOURS long, there's quite a lot of content here. Digimon World is quite expansive game, so no wonder. I won't mind if you watch it on higher speed (1.5x works best, it's a true game changer).\n\n...so, yeah. It's just an overly long video about a sad man trying to relieve the better times and everything associated with the journey.\n\nI hope that you'll enjoy it.\n\n...and thanks to everyone who watched the original videos!\n\nThe dream is over.\n\n#digimonworld #ps1 #digimon","link":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=7YPvKgG_Yvk","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YPvKgG_Yvk/sddefault.jpg","createdAt":"2024-01-08T15:48:00Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-22T04:17:26Z","author":{"name":"Hodyna","link":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCjwqvdtkuzNucmFkfpzdXpg"},"rate":"79","views":"1859","duration":"PT9H29M17S","tags":["Digimon","Digimon World","Digimon World 1","PS1","Nostalgia","[NOSTALGIA]","Chodyna","an","introspective","look","at","review","retrospective","let's","play","walkthrough","guide","City","Green","Gym","childhood","hopes","and","dreams","loser","comprehensive","big","mistake","chodyna","video","game","1999","documentary","DMW","PSX","classic","Platinum","training","care","mistakes","digivolution","heartfelt","File","every","medal","curling","perfect","card","informative","V-pet","Analogman","Arena","chart","Machinedramon","Monochrome","shop","prosperity","points","recruitment","complete","adverts","funny","numemon"]},{"id":"jQNeYbBiCKw","type":"Video","title":"The Decade-Long Quest For Shadow of the Colossus’ Last Secret","description":"a mystery which will never happen again,\na miracle which has never happened before–\nand shining this our now must come to then\n\nFollow me: https://twitter.com/yacobg42\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/JacobGeller\n\nReadings provided by: \nMML: https://www.youtube.com/user/MML129\nEuroThug4000: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxddeIv7GdHNcVPZI9JvGXQ\nTayls: https://twitter.com/TalesOfTayls\nGamesD: https://www.youtube.com/user/HotCyderable (also thanks for the exceptional opening montage and thumbnail bby)\n\nAdditional Footage Provided by Nomad Colossus: https://www.youtube.com/user/Nomad0168\n\nScript Consultation: Writing on Games (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlWv88ZRMxCcK3BGjrX7ew)\n\n2013 Eurogamer article on \"The Last Big Secret\" by Craig Owens: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-02-the-quest-for-shadow-of-the-colossuss-last-big-secret\n \nThe Thread: https://community.playstation.com/content/pdc/us/en_US/pdc-communities/playstation-general.topic.topic.0.25.html/quest_for_the_lastb-chNB\n\nOpening track: For Her Soul, Alex Roe: https://youtu.be/fo7MaxhyeXA\n\nVisual Media used: Shadow of the Colossus (2005 & 2018), ICO, Adventure, Mortal Kombat\n\nMusic used: For Her Soul (Alex Roe), Castle in the Mist (ICO), The Gates of Hell (Bayonetta), One Who Craves Souls (Demon's Souls), Various tracks from Octopath Traveler, Main Theme of Castle in the Sky","link":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=jQNeYbBiCKw","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jQNeYbBiCKw/sddefault.jpg","createdAt":"2019-08-08T14:30:04Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-25T21:35:15Z","author":{"name":"Jacob Geller","link":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCeTfBygNb1TahcNpZyELO8g"},"rate":"278677","views":"6572599","duration":"PT22M12S","tags":["shadow of the colossus","secret","hidden","nomad colossus","analysis","review","forum","search","quest","essay","easter egg","jacob geller"]},{"id":"peVgerhXJlU","type":"Video","title":"Castlevania Series Retrospective | A Complete History and Review","description":"The channel rises again thanks to the Patrons! - https://patreon.com/IFinishedAVideoGame\n\nThanks to Netflix, Castlevania is currently more popular than it's ever been but where are the new games?

I take a look at the title track from Undertale and how it uses an acoustic guitar to achieve the game's goal.\n\nUPDATE: I failed to recognise in this video that the acoustic guitar is not the ONLY live recorded in the entire soundtrack. There is a piano played in the track Last Goodbye. I don't think this detracts from my point too much, as it comes much later in the game (the end of a second play-through), isn't the focus of the track and there are already some rather realistic piano samples on the soundtrack so isn't used to the same effect.\n\n--\n\nTwitter: \nhttp://www.twitter.com/mittopotahis\nPatreon:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/gamescorefanfare\n\n--\n\n\"An Examination of Leitmotifs and Their Use to Shape Narrative in UNDERTALE\", by Jason Yu:\nhttp://jasonyu.me/undertale-part-1/\n\n\"Undertale & the Power of the Predominant | Ongaku Concept: Video Game Music Theory\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXdet1tqa5o\nThank you to Joshua Taipale for chatting with me about some of the theoretical things in the music.\n\nHere is a link from Toby Fox's tumblr about the original, unused version of the track.\nhttp://undertale.tumblr.com/post/150356633250/before-the-song-undertale-was-completed-it-went\n\nThank you to 8-Bit Music Theory for providing me with the transcriptions seen in this video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/8bitmusictheory\n\nThank you to Into The Score, for providing the footage from Final Fantasy VI.

Pokemon Diamond/Pearl hold a special place in my heart so I feel like it's fitting that they're the subject of the most complex project I've taken on to date.\n\nFrom an objective standpoint, the 4th gen games were a significant step up from their predecessors. Technically, they saw a number of benefits thanks to the DS's hardware. 2 screens? Now battles are more immersive since the UI is confined to the touch screen. Wireless communication? Now we don't have to connect a janky cable in order to battle. Wifi? _You're telling me I can trade with people all over the world?_ Coming from 3rd gen, it can't be overstated how massive a deal these improvements were.\n\nMore relevantly, 4th gen saw a massive step up in the music department thanks to the DS's beefed up audio system: the developers now had 16 channels of audio at their disposal compared to just 6 on the GBA, and you better believe they took full advantage of it. Gone were days of simplifying arrangements to fit the confines of the hardware - now the composers had the freedom to go hog wild with the instrumentation, and on some tracks it really shows, with layers upon layers of musical texture woven into the arrangements.\n\nFor a cover artist, that presents a big challenge; compared with previous generations, a typical track could easily take on average twice as long to arrange, record, and mix, if staying true to the original instrumentation. Anyone that's familiar with my channel knows that that's precisely what my covers are known for, so that accounts, in part, for what took this project so long compared to the Ruby/Sapphire medley.\n\nPersonally, the gen 4 games were probably the ones that I sunk the most time into out of any other generation; between the underground mines, GTS, and vast post-game content, there was always something to work towards. They were also one of the last that I played to completion before \"growing out\" of Pokemon in general. Perhaps that's among the reasons that I felt driven to really give this project everything I had to make it the best that I possibly could. In a strange way, this seems like a kind of closure to that period of my life.\n\nThe lengths I went to pull off some aspects of this project were borderline madness that had me questioning if it was really worth it. Among them: learning new instruments, renting a grand piano, practicing weeks on end to pull of short, but extremely challenging lines, tinkering with obsolete software to get video playing on the DS - really detail-oriented stuff, of which a lot wasn't 100% necessary, but really ties the project together IMO. I also went out of my way to find the best guest performers that I could to do justice to the variety of instrumentation found in the soundtrack and to hopefully realize the vision of what the composers had in mind when they wrote the music.\n\nRegardless of how bumpy the development of this project was, the final product is something I'm proud to have worked on, and I hope you enjoy it too.\n\n*Track list:*\n\n1.

Of all time. There's a reason the series was the first piece of media you saw on the channel, and it's because i'm so in love with the world Ryoko Kui has created.\n\nCharacter design has been talked about among the manga community. But i've never felt it's really delved into the how and why's of what makes character design just so important to creative storytelling and allowing it to really develop the world you're creating.\n\nWithout Ryoko Kui's varied approach and research towards character design, Dungeon Meshi simply wouldn't be the amazing story it is today. The casts' designs have shown to be integral to some plot devices, showcasing geographic worldbuilding etc, that I just HAD to make a video gushing about it.\n\n❤️ If you'd love to support the channel:  https://www.patreon.com/linesinmotion ❤️\n\nAs of the support from Patreon, I was able to commission the wonderful artist Gavryl Tampil to work on the absolutely stunning art piece you see at the begining of the video that really makes my new intro so lush.\nCouldn't recommend working with him enough, and you can find him here (thanks Gavryl!):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/_itsendy/\nhttp://gavryltampil.com/\n\n🍄 OTHER 🍄\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/linesinmotion\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@linesinmotionyt\nSOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5qZXYbLuIJ3mZubqSuVTY0AVi6pMJbFfJ-V0ne1fJA/edit?usp=sharing\n\n⚔️ TIMESTAMPS ⚔️\n00:00 - 03:35 What makes good character design?\n03:36 - 04:34 Summary and disclaimer\n04:35 - 12:29 Ryoko Kui’s work standing out\n12:30 - 14:32 Experimentation and sketch work\n14:33 - 20:33 Leaving conventional\n20:34 - 22:26 Ending\n22:27 - 23:55 Outro","link":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=z0Hr2_uX73o","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z0Hr2_uX73o/sddefault.jpg","createdAt":"2023-01-28T17:05:51Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-22T04:21:34Z","author":{"name":"lines in motion","link":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCbXBnHUfiuZJYfjmocDfhEQ"},"rate":"89567","views":"1254777","duration":"PT23M56S","tags":["delicious in dungeon","dungeon meshi","manga","video essay","character design","art","analysis"]},{"id":"TiN7tCEqdn4","type":"Video","title":"Ending Daily Vlogs after 15 Years","description":"Thank you for 15 incredible years full of memories.

Veiled by gothic and cosmic horror,  the game is a massive allegory for medical study and practice of a bygone era. In this introductory episode, we focus on key inspirations and establish the thesis of the series: Bloodborne depicts the nightmarish experience of Victorian-era illness and disease and the dehumanizing nature of medical research, surgery and addiction.\n\nMuch as Victorian medical scholars strove to understand the inner workings of the human body to gain mastery over death, Bloodborne's scholars are attempting to overcome the mortal bonds of humanity and become Great Ones.\n\nText is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqPEIcgvUwoJRclGxXny2xyaKRqR0xVeGdUf5uClu2Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\n#bloodborne \n#lore","link":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=SkNVKkYpgVU","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SkNVKkYpgVU/sddefault.jpg","createdAt":"2024-03-25T23:36:46Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-22T04:15:48Z","author":{"name":"Charred Thermos","link":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCb1uhSeyp83eYDWUVZP6V6A"},"rate":"4362","views":"84767","duration":"PT40M11S"},{"id":"YJMM92wDKZw","type":"Video","title":"A Super Mario Sunshine Deep Dive","description":"Over the last 8 months I have been steadily chipping away at this project, one location at a time.

Everything I demo'd was either a VST or soundfont version!\n\nThis is also sort of a \"spiritual successor\" to my video about how Toby Fox created Undertale's music...
