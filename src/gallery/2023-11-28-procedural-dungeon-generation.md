I like rogue-likes, and procedural generation is a fascinating subject to me.

The other day, I found a very cool article about the dungeon generation in [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/) by [BorisTheBrave](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/), and decided to take a shot at re-creating his implementation in JavaScript into a Godot playable version.

If you wanna check it out, I've made a [demo](https://kulugary.itch.io/procedural-dungeon-generator) over at my [Itch.io](https://kulugary.itch.io/) and you can also check out the code over at [GitHub](https://github.com/KuluGary/procedural-dungeon-generator).
