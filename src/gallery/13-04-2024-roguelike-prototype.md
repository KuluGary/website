In a previous [post](/gallery/2023-11-28-procedural-dungeon-generation/), I've re-created [BorisTheBrave](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/)'s implementation of [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)'s dungeon generation algorithm in Godot. In addition, I've also followed [Matinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axMNUTmFEDA&list=PL2-ArCpIQtjELkyLKec8BaVVCeunuHSK9)'s roguelike tutorial series.

In this video I showcase a prototype I've made with a basic dungeon generation and character controller.
