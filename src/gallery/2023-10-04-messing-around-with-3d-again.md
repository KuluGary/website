In a previous post I've said how I'd keep trying some 3D stuff. While I did that, I also tried to replicate the look & feel of the text message system from [A Short Hike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/). There's this helpful [YouTube video by DashNothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DRy5An_6DU) that I've used as a starting point to develop what you see in the screenshot.
